# VAIA â€” Vienna AI Alignment Group

Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are rapidly becoming more powerful and deeply ingrained into the fabric of society. _AI alignment_ deals with the problem of building powerful AI systems that adhere to their intended goals and are _"helpful, harmless and honest"_. 

Our goal is to provide a network for professionals working on AI alignment in Vienna and Austria, and to strengthen the global visibility of Vienna among global AI stakeholders.
